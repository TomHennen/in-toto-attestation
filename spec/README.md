# in-toto Attestation Framework Spec

Latest version: [v1.1]

An **in-toto attestation** is authenticated metadata about one or more
software artifacts[^1]. The intended consumers are automated policy engines,
such as [in-toto-verify] and [Binary Authorization].

It has four layers that are independent but designed to work together:

-   [Predicate]: Contains arbitrary metadata about a subject artifact, with a
    type-specific schema.
-   [Statement]: Binds the attestation to a particular subject and
    unambiguously identifies the types of the predicate.
-   [Envelope]: Handles authentication and serialization.
-   [Bundle]: Defines a method of grouping multiple attestations together.

The following diagram visualises the relationships between the envelope, statement and predicate layers.

The source of this diagram can be found [here](../images/envelope_relationships.excalidraw).

The [validation model] provides pseudocode showing how these layers fit
together. See the [documentation] for more background and examples.
